# Build a Monochrome, High‑Polish Consultancy Website (SSR React)

You are Replit AI. Build a production‑ready consultancy website inspired by D3’s vibe (animations, crisp UI) but **not** a clone. The brand is new; default name: **AstraVantage Consulting** (you may change in `/config/brand.ts`).

## Tech Stack & Constraints

* **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router) with **SSR by default** and SSG where suitable.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + CSS variables. One primary accent only.
* **UI Kit:** shadcn/ui (tree‑shaken components) + **lucide-react** icons.
* **Animation:** **Framer Motion** (delightful, subtle; 60fps).
* **Fonts:** Inter for UI, optional display: Plus Jakarta Sans. Load via `next/font/google`.
* **Forms:** server actions (Next 14) + fallback to a POST endpoint. Provide easy switch to Formspark/Netlify.
* **Images:** next/image; add low‑quality blur placeholders.
* **Lint/Format:** ESLint + Prettier + strict TS. No any.
* **Accessibility:** WCAG AA, keyboard nav, focus rings, reduced motion support.
* **Performance:** Lighthouse ≥ 95 (mobile & desktop). Animations GPU‑friendly (opacity, transform). Avoid layout thrash.

## Visual Direction (Bright, White, Monochrome)

* Background: **pure white** (#FFFFFF); text: near‑black (#111); subtle grays (#F7F7F7, #EDEDED, #DADADA).
* Single accent: **#1E90FF** ("Signal Blue"). Use **sparingly**: CTAs, hover states, links, small dividers.
* Elevation via soft shadows, glass‑light overlays, and hairline borders (1px #EDEDED).
* Micro‑interactions: link underlines expand on hover; cards lift 2–4px with subtle shadow.

## Information Architecture & Routes

* `/` Home (hero, services, proof, case studies preview, credibility strip, CTA)
* `/services` Overview + detail anchors:

  * Digital Marketing
  * Manufacturing Analytics
  * Digital Transformation
  * Customer Success
* `/case-studies` Index and dynamic pages `/case-studies/[slug]`
* `/about` Founder/leadership, values, approach, credentials
* `/contact` Form + company details; success & error states
* **Header:** sticky, transparent → solid on scroll; **Blog** link goes to `https://google.com` for now.
* **Footer:** compact sitemap, contact, socials (LinkedIn only placeholder), copyright.

## Pages – Content & Layout Requirements

### 1) Home `/`

* **Hero:**

  * Headline: “Strategy. Systems. Scale.”
  * Subhead: “Consulting across Digital Marketing, Manufacturing Analytics, Digital Transformation, and Customer Success—rooted in outcomes.”
  * Primary CTA: **Start a Conversation** (scroll to contact or `/contact`).
  * Secondary CTA: **View Case Studies**.
  * **Visual:** Animated abstract grid + particles (Framer Motion) that react to pointer (parallax) and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
* **Service Tiles (4):** monochrome cards with minimal icon, 1‑liner value prop, link to detail anchor on `/services`.
* **Credibility Strip:** logos (placeholder) in grayscale with hover tint to accent.
* **Case Studies Teaser:** 3 cards with KPI highlights (e.g., “+38% MQLs”, “‑22% downtime”). Clicking → detail page.
* **Why Us:** three pillars—“Senior‑led”, “Data‑native”, “Operator mindset”. Include small motion checkmarks.
* **Final CTA Band:** short pitch, email + CTA button.

### 2) Services `/services`

* **Intro:** positioning + engagement model (diagnose → blueprint → pilot → scale).
* **Sections** (anchors):

  * **Digital Marketing:** growth loops, CRO, measurement, campaign ops. Bulleted deliverables.
  * **Manufacturing Analytics:** OEE, SPC dashboards, predictive maintenance, quality analytics; sample KPIs.
  * **Digital Transformation:** process mapping, tooling audit, change mgmt, integration roadmap.
  * **Customer Success:** onboarding, lifecycle health scores, churn signals, playbooks.
* Each section includes: problem → approach → outcomes → 2–3 example artifacts (cards).

### 3) Case Studies `/case-studies` & `[slug]`

* Index filters: Industry, Capability, Impact (range slider), Year.
* Card layout: title, 1‑line context, **3 metric chips** with arrows (▲▼) and tooltips.
* Detail page structure:

  * Context (client, industry, challenge)
  * Approach (phases)
  * Solution Architecture (diagram block)
  * Outcomes (before/after metrics table)
  * Testimonial (quote card)
  * CTA to contact

### 4) About `/about`

* Founder story (write as neutral placeholder), values, operating principles.
* Timeline (vertical) with subtle scroll reveal.
* Certifications/logos (gray), LinkedIn link.

### 5) Contact `/contact`

* Split layout: form (name, email, company, role, topic select, message) + sidebar (email, LinkedIn, location).
* Validation with Zod + server action. Show success state with confetti animation (reduced motion safe).

## Components & Effects

* **Header:**

  * Sticky. On scroll past hero, background fades from transparent → white w/ border.
  * Active link underline animates.
* **Magnetic CTA Button:** slight cursor attraction, accessible.
* **Particles/Noise Layer:** optional; keep GPU cheap.
* **Metric Chips:** animated count‑ups (on in‑view) for case study KPIs.

## Data & Content Seeds

Provide JSON seeds in `/data` used by SSG where appropriate:

* `caseStudies.json` (5 examples):

```json
[
  {
    "slug": "precision-plant-oee-lift",
    "title": "OEE Lift in Precision Manufacturing",
    "industry": "Manufacturing",
    "capabilities": ["Manufacturing Analytics", "Digital Transformation"],
    "year": 2024,
    "summary": "Unified line telemetry and SPC to cut unplanned downtime.",
    "metrics": [{"label":"OEE","delta":12,"unit":"pp"},{"label":"Downtime","delta":-22,"unit":"%"},{"label":"Yield","delta":+7,"unit":"%"}],
    "sections": {"context": "…", "approach": ["…"], "solution": "…", "outcomes": [{"metric":"OEE","before":58,"after":70}]}
  },
  {
    "slug": "b2b-lead-engine",
    "title": "B2B Demand Engine for Enterprise SaaS",
    "industry": "Software",
    "capabilities": ["Digital Marketing", "Customer Success"],
    "year": 2023,
    "summary": "Full‑funnel build: intent capture → qualification → winback.",
    "metrics": [{"label":"MQLs","delta":38,"unit":"%"},{"label":"CPL","delta":-27,"unit":"%"},{"label":"LTV","delta":19,"unit":"%"}]
  }
]
```

* `services.ts` with title, blurb, bullets, icon name.
* `testimonials.json` with placeholder quotes.

## Brand Config & Theming

Create `/config/brand.ts`:

```ts
export const brand = {
  name: "AstraVantage Consulting",
  accent: "#1E90FF",
  neutral: {
    bg: "#FFFFFF",
    text: "#111111",
    line: "#EDEDED",
  },
  meta: {
    title: "AstraVantage — Strategy. Systems. Scale.",
    description: "Consultancy across Digital Marketing, Manufacturing Analytics, Digital Transformation, and Customer Success.",
  }
};
```

Wire Tailwind CSS variables from this config for easy theme swap.

## SEO, Metadata, & Schema

* Next SEO via metadata API; canonical URLs; OG/Twitter images.
* JSON‑LD per page:

  * Organization (logo, sameAs LinkedIn)
  * BreadcrumbList
  * Article for case studies
* Sitemap at `/sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`.

## Header & Nav

* Left: logotype (text logo driven by brand name, no image needed initially).
* Right: links **Home, Services, Case Studies, About, Contact, Blog** (Blog → `https://google.com`).
* Mobile: animated sheet/drawer with staggered links.

## Footer

* Small; three columns: About blurb, Quick Links, Contact.
* Newsletter input (non‑functional placeholder with success toast).

## Copywriting Tone

* Senior, outcome‑driven, direct. Avoid fluff. One‑liners that sell impact.

## Animations (Framer Motion) — Rules

* Entrance: `opacity` + `y: 12` translate; stagger children.
* Hover: scale 1.02 max; shadow +2.
* Underlines: width animate from 0 → 100% on hover and active route.
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and provide static fallbacks.

## Accessibility

* Semantic landmarks; aria‑labels for icon‑only.
* Visible focus outlines (accent color); focus trap in mobile menu.
* Color contrast checked.

## Analytics & Consent (Optional Stubs)

* Add a hook for GTM/GA with consent banner stub (no network calls by default).

## Acceptance Criteria (Do Not Skip)

1. **SSR/SSG**: Pages render on server; case study detail pages statically generated from `caseStudies.json`.
2. **Header** is sticky with transparent→solid transition; **Blog** goes to `https://google.com`.
3. **Hero** includes animated background (subtle particles/parallax) and two CTAs.
4. **Services page** has four anchor sections with bullets and example artifacts.
5. **Case studies** index filter works client‑side; detail pages show metrics table and testimonial.
6. **Contact form** validates with Zod, posts to `/api/contact`, shows success and error states.
7. **Monochrome theme** with single accent; hover/active effects only use that accent.
8. **Lighthouse ≥ 95** on performance/accessibility/best practices/SEO in a fresh build.
9. **A11y:** keyboard nav through header/menu/cards/forms.
10. **Code quality:** strict TS, no unused vars, organized components, no inline styles except quick layout.

## Helpful Sample Content
